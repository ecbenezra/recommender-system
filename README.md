# Movie Recommender System
Exploring different kinds of movie recommender systems

This repository contains files for a recommender system project

## Explanation of Files

* [Dataset Gathering and Scraping](https://github.com/ecbenezra/recommender-system/blob/master/dataset-compiling-scraping.ipynb) - a jupyter notebook documenting the scraping process from IMDb using the OMDB API. Since I am planning onusing the MovieLens 20M dataset for user-user recommender system later on, I wanted to do the other systems on the same movies, so that I can compare them. I scraped movie data including director, actors, title, box office, plot, genres, and more, from 25,634 movies.

* [All datasets cleaning and exploration](https://github.com/ecbenezra/recommender-system/blob/master/all-datasets-cleaning-exploration.ipynb) - cleaning of the three major datasets involved in this process - self scraped data from IMDb, the Movie Database, and the MovieLens 100k dataset. This file contains the cleaning and exploratory visualization for all of the metadata involved in the datasets.
