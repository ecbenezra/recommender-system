    "# Recommending Without User Data: Content Filtering With NLP and Cosine Similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "Using data previously cleaned, I'm going to use several methods of NLP along with cosine similarity to make a simple, initial movie recommendation system. This sytem can be used to recommend movies when users are brand new. There are several ways this can be used:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The user can search for similar movies to a movie they like when a user first signs up with the app or service, but movies will be very closely related (Iron Man, Iron Man II, Iron Man III, etc)\n",
    "2. The app can use this feature to suggest similar movies for the User to initially rate. I.e if the user says they like Toy Story, movies with a high cosine similarity can be the next suggestions for a user to rate the movie. \n",
    "3. This method can be used to group similar movies together into recommended \"pods\". For example, \"Japanese animation featuring strong female leads\" might include Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features Used For Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rated** - The movie's rating\n",
    "* **Year** - The Release Year\n",
    "* **Genre** - The movie's genres\n",
    "* **Writer** - Who wrote the screenplay\n",
    "* **Actors** - Significant actors in the movie\n",
    "* **Director** - who directed the movies\n",
    "* **Key words** - Key words taken from the plot using [nltk_rake](https://pypi.org/project/rake-nltk/)"

    "# Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This is a good initial filter for a website or app that gives movie recommendations for movies that are similar\n",
    "2. Depending on the movie, key metrics like diveristy/variety differ. Below is analysis for a few of the recommendations:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\n",
    "All the movies that are also in the Lord of the Rings Franchise are returned, along with Harry Potter. But it also suggests a variety of other movies that are somewhat similar in tone, though none of them seem to be High Fantasy the same way that Lord of the Rings is. It's important to note, however, that there are two filters: The first filters for cosine similarity, the second filters the results by the weighted IMDB rating. By cosine similarity **only**, we also get movies from the Hobbit franchise, which are closely related to Lord of the Rings as it exists in the same Universe. However, these movies had a lower weighted rating on IMDB than other movies, so were suggested later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Movies recommended **ordered by cosine similarity**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'**, also in the franchise\n",
    "2. **'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers'**, also in the franchise\n",
    "3. **'The Lord of the Rings (1978)**, the 1978 animated film of the same movie\n",
    "4. **'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'** a similar movie in terms of high fantasy and plot\n",
    "5. **'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug'** also in the franchise\n",
    "6. **'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'** also in the franchise\n",
    "7. **'The Long and Short of It'** - a short film made by crew during the filming of LoTR: The Two Towers\n",
    "8. **'What Dreams May Come'** - a 1998 film that features tangential similarities, a 'journey' through a foreign land as the main character traverses through the afterlife in various forms, I'm not sure if this would be popular for lovers of LoTR as it's a different kind of 'fantasy' and 'drama'\n",
    "9. **'The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies'** another Hobbit film\n",
    "10. **'The Lovely Bones'** - Another movie that involves the afterlife, I'm not sure this would be popular among people who love LoTR\n",
    "11. **'The Price of Milk'** - A romantic comedy filmed in New Zealand, where the LoTR franchise was filmed\n",
    "12. **'Hunt for the Wilderpeople'** - Another example of I think the algorithm using 'drama'\n",
    "13. **'Thor'** - probably more of a movie that would be enjoyed by LoTR fans, as it's fantasy and deals more with 'war'\n",
    "14. **'Captain Marvel'** - Similar to Thor, I think this is closer to what users would want to be recommended\n",
    "15. **'Camille'** - has to do with journey through the afterlife\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall takeaway for LoTR: Fellowship Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommendations all have to do with a hero's journey, loss, and in many cases the afterlife. Most of them have some sort of fantastical element, though the recommendations fall short of what LoTR fans might like. I don't think this is a great filter to show to people who love recommendations, but think it could be improved if there were some more keywords (perhaps user-inputted keywords like 'High fantasy' and 'war'). \n",
    "\n",
    "The MovieLens recommender also recommends Star Wars and Indiana Jones based on Lord of the Rings. For computational time, this version of the filter only uses movies from 1988 and beyond, and therefore misses Star Wars and Indiana Jones, for the most part, but not the new Star Wars movies, which I suppose are not close enough to be recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that, in terms of themes, these **are good picks**. These movies all have thematic links, about loss and sacrifice and the inevitability of entropy and how power attracts the corruptible. Except Joe Dirt, I'm not sure what that's about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Spirited Away\n",
    "The results for *Spirited Away*, the award-winning 2001 animation, are a little more consistent across the board. Most of the other movies are also Japanese animation from the same studio, Studio Ghibli, making the diversity and variety of this set lower than Lord of the Rings, which recommended quite a few different genres, directors, and film ideas (which is good and bad, in its own way).\n",
    "\n",
    "Movies recommended **filtered by cosine similarity and ordered by the weighted IMDB rating**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Howl's Moving Castle** - deals with many similar themes and is from the same studio/director\n",
    "* **My Neighbor Totoro** - also from Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, this movie also features strong female leads, as two girls who have moved to a new home (similar) encounter strange creatures and beasts\n",
    "* **Castle in the Sky** - Another Miyazaki with similar qualities, female leads, strange journies and beasts (to be fair, these themes run through most of Miyazaki's works)\n",
    "* **Porco Rosso** - Also from Miyazaki\n",
    "* **Ponyo** - Also from Miyazaki\n",
    "* **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone** - a similar theme and idea of a child taken away from their parents and treated poorly by those around them (Harry loses his parents, Chihiro in Spirited Away has her parents turned into pigs). Other, magical themes run through both of these stories, making this a decent recommendation.\n",
    "* **Mei and the Kitten Bus** - a spinoff short film with characters from Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro, this takes the younger girl Mei and the 'kitten bus' (based off the cat bus) from that film.\n",
    "* **Pom Poko** - from Studio Ghibli / Miyazaki\n",
    "* **The Cat Returns** - from Studio Ghibli / Miyazaki\n",
    "* **My Neighbors the Yamadas** - from Studio Ghibli / Miyazaki\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall takeway for Spirited Away:\n",
    "These recommendations are certainly more consistent and better than they were for Lord of Rings, but are a little strict in terms of who the director is, for example. I would have loved to get back some other Japanese animation (however I don't even know if that's in my dataframe). However, again, the algorithm has returned movies that rest on pretty similar thematic lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is good at finding underlying thematic tones of movies and returning them, even if they aren't strictly in the same genre. Some tuning to the algorithm would perhaps enhance it, playing with NLP to see what could be done with n-grams instead of just a bag of words, or other processes like word2vec, as well as lemmatization or stemming, which I did not do in this iteration of the filter. Overall, I'm happy with how it performs, and thin it would be a good initial interface for someone to interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ideas for further tuning and research\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd love to try this out with more tags. For example, *Spirited Away*'s original language was Japanese, but it was translated and widely released into English, and Studio Ghibli is partnered with Pixar, who is owned by Disney. These lines could help bridge the gaps between certain movies. In an earlier version of this filter, Spirited Away returned *Alice in Wonderland*, which thrilled me. That doesn't seem to be the case this time, which is disappointing, but makes me wonder about how we might get a machine to see those gaps and leap across them, especially using a distance function such as cosine similarity.
